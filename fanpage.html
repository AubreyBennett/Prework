    <h1>Queen Tribute Page!</h1>

    <p>Bio: 
    </p>Queen was formed in London in 1970. Their career got off to a rocky start when their first album "Queen" did not do as well as they had anticipated. It wasn't until the release of their second album, "Queen 2," that they began their journey to unbelievable sucess. In the following years they released many more albums, one of which is my personal favorite, A Night at the Opera.
